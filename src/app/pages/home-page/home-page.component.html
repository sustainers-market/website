        Once a service grows enough to reach sustainability (its revenue
        is enough to cover its expenses) any profit is rewarded back to its
        users as a refund, or reinvested into the network as needed.

        People and businesses try to make money because they want to be sustainable, so why not replace the question "How will my I make money?" with "What does sustainbility mean to me providing this service?". The market will work to sustain the services it thinks should exist.
        For digital services with fixed operating costs, profit margins can grow
        enormously as number of users increase. Most businesses reinvest these
        funds or pay them out to its shareholders.

      <p>
        Once operating expenses are covered and the business can sustain itself,
        sustainable services put excess revenue toward sustaining the Network,
        or redistribute it to users in the form of a refund.

    <div class="header">Why?</div>
    <p>
      Because most expenses for digital services don't increase with scale, it's
      natural for these businesses to amass huge amounts of capital. But the
      world doesn't need more billionaires. The Sustainer Network offers
      business owners a more sustainable option for providing a service to
      customers.
